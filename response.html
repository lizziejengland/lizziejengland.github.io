                I found As We May Think to be very thought provoking and interesting, especially considering the fact that it was written 
                in 1945. Dr. Bush’s main points seemed to be about the way we learned and took in new information at the time, and how we 
                can make it more efficient. His idea of Memex resembled modern file paths in my opinion, though more personalized to the user. 
                At the time, file paths were not a prominent feature in technology, but now that we have this feature I do not entirely see the 
                need for the functions that Memex provides. The one aspect that I did enjoy was that you could forget what you’ve learned because
                 finding the information that you’ve forgotten would be incredibly easy. This could change the way we learn in schools and go about 
                 life in general. While this is an interesting idea, it does remind me of the technology in dystopian stories and shows like Black Mirror, 
                 which makes me wonder if this idea could actually work.
