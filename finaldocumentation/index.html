                        first i copied the code from my medium is the massage Project
                        then i added a ton of assets - 100 assets
                        i tried to make a for loop to go through them but it was not working so 
                        i ended up just entering them manually
                        then i made sure that they could not be repeated
                        now i am trying to get the drag and drop working but it is hard
                    </p>
